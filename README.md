**Hey, I'm Jake.**

I'm an undergraduate studying a Bachelor of Biomedical Engineering (Honours) and a Bachelor of Medical Science at the University of Technology in Sydney.

In my spare time I'm developing open source medicine focused applications.

I'm an amateur hacker, I hold the equivalent of a Diploma in Information Technology focused in Cyber Security and Programming.
