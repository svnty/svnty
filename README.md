**Hey, I'm Jake.**

I'm doing a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Biomedical Engineering and a Bachelor of Medical Science.

In my spare time I'm developing open source medicine focused applications.

I'm an amateur hacker, I hold the equivalent of a Diploma in Information Technology focused in Cyber Security and Programming.
